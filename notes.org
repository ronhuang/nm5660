* Universal Usability
All about dynamic and flexibility.

** Agenda
*** Technology variety
*** User diversity
*** Gaps in User Knowledge
- A fundamental interface and information design research problem is
  how to support evolutionary learning.
- Layered implementation.


* How does Mellow Interaction fit in?


* Ubiquitous computing
- Invisible interface (Weiser 1994, Cooperstock 1995, Fishkin 1998)

** Invisibility was a key feature of at least three other lines of argument
- User-Centered Design (Norman and Draper 1986)
- Information appliances (Invisible computer)
- Tangible interaction

** However, invisible interface is too simplistic
- If invisible, it can not be engaging, it can not communicate.
- Interface may mediate user action.
- (Refer to Windows and Mirrors.)

* User experience
** Richer models
- Embodied Interaction
  - Tangible computing
  - Social computing
    - About the context in which computation is put to work.
    - The interaction between the designer and the user is through the
      system. This implies that even the most isolated and individual
      interaction with a computer system is still fundamentally a
      social activity.
- User Experience -- a research agenda (three perspectives)
  - Beyond the instrumental (characteristics of the designed system)
  - Emotion and affect (user's internal state)
  - The experiental (context)

** Why difficult to have universal definition
 - Associated with broad range of concepts (depending on author's
   background.)
 - Unit of analysis for UX is too malleable

** ISO definition
A person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or
anticipated use of a product, system or service.

(No social aspect?) Survey approach says no. Co-experience says yes.


* Patterns for User Experience


* Brief description of context


* Information Transparency
Is it required to have transparent user experience?

* Transparency in UNIX



* Transparency in Recommender System
Transparency improves the search performance.


* Articulating the experience of transparency: an example of field research techniques
Rutkowski (1982) proposes that transparency is the ideal relationship
between user and tool, with the tool seeming to disappear.


* Examples
- Confusion between Wifi and Bluetooth
- PS2 O and X buttons


* The Inmates Are Running the Asylum
Although programmers work hard to make their software easy to use,
their frame of reference is themselves and as a result they make it
easy for other software engineers, not normal human beings.  He argues
that programmers have too much influence over the design of the human
interface and due to a lack of skills in this area do a poor job of
it.

* Future of digital design
- Usability engineering
- Interaction design

* HCI and software engineers
