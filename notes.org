* Universal Usability
All about dynamic and flexibility.

** Agenda
*** Technology variety
*** User diversity
*** Gaps in User Knowledge
- A fundamental interface and information design research problem is
  how to support evolutionary learning.
- Layered implementation.


* How does Mellow Interaction fit in?


* Ubiquitous computing
- Invisible interface (Weiser 1994, Cooperstock 1995, Fishkin 1998)

** Invisibility was a key feature of at least three other lines of argument
- User-Centered Design (Norman and Draper 1986)
- Information appliances (Invisible computer)
- Tangible interaction

** However, invisible interface is too simplistic
- If invisible, it can not be engaging, it can not communicate.
- Interface may mediate user action.
- (Refer to Windows and Mirrors.)

* User experience
** Richer models
- Embodied Interaction
  - Tangible computing
  - Social computing
    - About the context in which computation is put to work.
    - The interaction between the designer and the user is through the
      system. This implies that even the most isolated and individual
      interaction with a computer system is still fundamentally a
      social activity.
- User Experience -- a research agenda (three perspectives)
  - Beyond the instrumental (characteristics of the designed system)
  - Emotion and affect (user's internal state)
  - The experiental (context)

** Why difficult to have universal definition
 - Associated with broad range of concepts (depending on author's
   background.)
 - Unit of analysis for UX is too malleable

** ISO definition
A person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or
anticipated use of a product, system or service.

(No social aspect?) Survey approach says no. Co-experience says yes.


* Brief description of context


* Information Transparency
Is it required to have transparent user experience?



* Transparency in Recommender System
Transparency improves the search performance.


* Articulating the experience of transparency: an example of field research techniques
Rutkowski (1982) proposes that transparency is the ideal relationship
between user and tool, with the tool seeming to disappear.


* Examples
- Confusion between Wifi and Bluetooth
- PS2 O and X buttons
